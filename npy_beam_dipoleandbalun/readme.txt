"Dear Nima, Here is a dropbox link to the beam pattern for the hexagonal dipole with a 10m ground plane and a balun. It is gridded onto every degree, with the data in a (65160,3,151) array. The second axis has the angle of inclination from zenith in element 0, the angle of rotation from the x axis in element 1 and the absolute gain in that direction in element 2. The 3rd axis is frequency, giving the beams at every MHz from 50MHz to 200MHz. I hope this makes sense. Let me know if there are any problems. Regards, Dominic"
